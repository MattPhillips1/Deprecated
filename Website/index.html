Hey! I am currently a second year Electrical Engineering(Hons)/Computer Science student at UNSW from the small town of Byron Bay.
I have developed a passion for all things computer science and have written this website both as web development practice and a sort of resume. 
(And just because I wanted my own website. Who doesn't?)
